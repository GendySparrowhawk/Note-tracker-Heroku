## Description
Notes tracker uses a backend server to connect user data and inputs to keep track of notes, return those notes, and delete them when they are no longer required. 

### Dependencies
I used these applications to build this project.
1. ![node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
2. ![javaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)
3. ![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
4. [UUID generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)
### Installing
No install needed.

### Running
once on the webpage click the note button. Once on the notes page you can add any note you like with a title and a text value. Once both are filled out a save button appears and you can save and/clear your note. It will be stored until you delete it with the red icon. 

## Help
Again it is not until you populate both fields that the save/clear buttons appear. It looks sparce on loading but can fill up quickly.
